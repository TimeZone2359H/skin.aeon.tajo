# skin.aeon.tajo

Skin for Kodi.

This is a modified version of Manfeed's Aeon Tajo. Changes include;
1.	Add a bigger clock in home and music visualization windows
2.	Use coloured studio icon instead of white (redundant with the lastest skin) in videodialog window and make the icons slightly bigger
3.	Add last aired and next aired for TV shows using TMDB helper addon
4.	Add TV show status i.e ended, continuing, returning series, cancelled etc.
5.	Add movie set labels including years, directors, writers, genres and countries using skin info helper addon.
6.	Add artist biography, discography and similar artist that scroll as RSS feed in music visualization window
7.	Add Tomatometer and Metacritic Ratings. Show IMDB, TMDB and Trakt ratings simultaneously (This is redundant, the skin supports it natively now.)
